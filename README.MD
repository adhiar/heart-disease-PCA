# Heart Disease Prediction With Dimensional Reduction (PCA) on Several Model in SKlearn

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Predicting heart disease at an early stage can significantly improve patient outcomes by enabling timely intervention. This project leverages machine learning (ML) to predict heart disease occurrence based on patient data, including medical histories, lab results, and other health indicators. By analyzing large datasets, ML can uncover patterns and relationships that may be challenging to detect with traditional diagnostic methods.
